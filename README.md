# Project: Website Optimization
I will optimize a provided website with a number of optimization- and performance-related issues so that it achieves a target PageSpeed score and runs at 60 frames per second.

## Project Goals
### 1 .PageSpeed Score: Critical Rendering Path
  - `index.html` achieves a `PageSpeed` score of at least 90 for Mobile and Desktop.
### 2. Getting Rid of Jank
  - **Frame Rate**
Optimizations made to `views/js/main.js` make `views/pizza.html` render with a consistent frame-rate at `60fps` when scrolling.
  - **Computational Efficiency**
Time to resize pizzas is less than 5 ms using the pizza size slider on the `views/pizza.html` page. Resize time is shown in the browser developer tools.
### 3. Documentation
  - **README**
A `README` file is included detailing all steps required to successfully run the application and outlines the optimizations that the student made in `index.html` and `views/js/main.js` for `pizza.html`.
  - **Comments**
Comments in `views/js/main.js` for `pizza.html` are present and effectively explain longer code procedures.
